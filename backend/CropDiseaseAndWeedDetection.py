This is the Crop Disease and Weed Detection module for CropBot.

The model defined below accepts a 256 x 256 x 3 image and classifies it
as one of either N diseased crops or 2 weed-types.

This model produced a 98% accuracy with the "New Plant Diseases Dataset"
which can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset

To actually train this model, you will have to first download the above dataset
and then change "TRAIN_DIR" and "VALID_DIR" (at the bottom) to the appropriate training directory
and validation directory.
