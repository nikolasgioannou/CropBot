# CropBot: Empowering Low-Income Farmers with AI 
# *By Nikolas Ioannou, Rinav Kasthuri, and Sage Khanuja*

## Overview
CropBot is a mobile application that allows farmers across the globe to more smartly utilize their fields. This smarter utilization is facilitated through our voice assistant, Tea, who asks the farmer relevant questions about the state of his or her field to gauge prospective betterments and then implement them.

## Inspiration
Most of our team comes from India. We’d witnessed the robbing of numerous farmers’ livelihoods due to preying middlemen, landlords, or simply a lack of relevant knowledge. We were surprised to find that there were no existing apps that focused on increasing accessibility of this knowledge for impoverished farmers. Thus, it became clear to us that there’d be a prominent utility for an app that could combat crop diseases, predict shock events such as droughts or floods, and provide useful information like the best crop to grow based on the land’s geographical features. Moreover, this presented our team with an opportunity and a challenge—to utilize our machine learning and app development skill sets to better the lives of millions.

## Methods
TF 2.0 was used to producing the crop disease and weed detection, best crop, crop price, and drought prediction models.

This section will be split into three subsections to delineate the distinct models used to produce the aforementioned features:

  1. Crop Disease and Weed Detection
  2. Best Crop Prediction
  3. Crop Price Prediction
  4. Drought Prediction

## Impact
Our primary goal with CropBot is to help the impoverished and illiterate farmers who are being left to starve when droughts, storms, and floods, ravenous landlords or relatively richer farmers simply discard their livelihoods. Using CropBot, these farmers can significantly improve their situations by not only learning more on the field, but also by learning more about the field itself. Additionally, we have implemented our application through both text and voice to accommodate the desponding illiteracy that still unfortunately prevails in today’s world. In its ideal form, the app could potentially reduce the disparity between the yields of rich and poor farmers from 214% to a miniscule 5% (Restuccia et al., 2017).
